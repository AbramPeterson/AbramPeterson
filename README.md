<h2> About me and why you may want to follow me! </h2>
As a seasoned SOC Analyst, I specialize in monitoring systems and networks for unauthorized activities, analyzing network data, and researching cyber threats. My background includes network monitoring, risk assessments, and ensuring compliance with industry-standard security frameworks such as NIST SP 800 53, JSIG, and NISPOM. As a Network Engineer, I install, configure, and maintain LANs, WANs, and various network devices, focusing on high availability and security. I hold an MS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance and a BS in Cyber Security. My skill set includes Linux, virtualization, networking, and security tools, with hands-on experience in homelab projects and active participation in cybersecurity learning activities.

I strive to teach others about cybersecurity and IT; I am not a fan of the influencer mindset, but I am here to teach you real in-demand skills that will have you job-ready from day one. There is no hype behind my content, the intent is to teach you HANDS ON skills that will allow you to perform real world tasks. My content is focused on depth, demand, and detail; there is no hype or a promise of making six figures here, just that you will walk away better prepared for your next role or interview.
